It is crucial to understand an application's behavior, either to analyze specific events to find errors, monitor the application's performance, or track activities in a distributed system. Observability is the capability of an application to do that, through logs, metrics, and tracing.

In this article Iâ€™ll be talking about metrics, how to configure an ASP NET Core application to generate metrics, set up Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize the metrics.

Metrics are the application's telemetry data over time. For example, the number of requests of an API, the number of errors, and the latency of the request. It is essential to collect that data and monitor it, for example to react to application degradation incidents or understand the application behavior to implement performance improvements.

### Creating an API

The first step here is to create an API using ASP NET Core. I created an API for a fictitious sporting goods store called ShopSports. It has an `/api/Products` endpoint that returns a list of products, containing the name, price and availability. This API needs to communicate with two external services, one for retrieving the products prices, and another to get the procuts availability. In order to simulate a real use scenario, this API generates random delays during the products query to the database, and delays when retrieving data in the other services.

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> GetAsync()
{
    var products = await _productRepository.GetAsync();
    var fillPricesTask = _priceService.FillPricesAsync(products);
    var fillAvailabilityTask = _inventoryService.FillAvailabilityAsync(products);
    await Task.WhenAll(fillPricesTask, fillAvailabilityTask);
    return Ok(products);
}
```

### Open Telemetry

The next step is to configure the application to generate metrics. Open Telemetry will be used for that, which is an open source platform of observability, technology agnostic, that supports log, metrics and distributed tracings. ASP NET Core has its Open Telemetry implementation, in the following packages:

```
OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore
OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console
```

After installing these packages, add the following configuration to de dependency injection container configuration:

```cs
var openTelemetryBuilder = builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry();

openTelemetryBuilder.ConfigureResource(resource => resource
    .AddService(builder.Environment.ApplicationName));

openTelemetryBuilder.WithMetrics(metrics => metrics
    .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
    .AddConsoleExporter());
```

This configuration adds some metrics  by default. We will be looking at the one called `http.server.request.duration`. As the name suggests, this metric measures the request duration which is in seconds.

Since we have added the ```AddConsoleExporter``` to the configuration, a console exporter will be available. An exporter is a way of accessing the snapshot of the metrics at a given period in time. The console exporter will output the metrics from time to time.

This is the console output after doing three request to the ```/api/Producs``` endpoint:

- The type of this metric is Histogram. It registers frequency of values within a range.
- Note that we have defined ranges of values and a number for it. These ranges of values are called buckets. In this example, two of these requests took between 0.75 and 1 second, and the other one took between 1.2 and 5 seconds.
- We have additional information attached to the metrics, for example the `http.response.status_code` and `http.route`. These information are called tags, and can be useful for filtering data.
